    Blackhorse Road Christmas
</h1>
<p>
    For the first time ever (apart from the cancelled COVID Christmas) we're having Christmas at home.
</p><p>
    Mum and Dad are joining us Tuesday-Sunday.
    Unfortunately they had a bit of bad luck - their car was stolen on Christmas morning so they had to take the train back, but a power failure at Finsbury park meant that they had to wait for buses to get to Euston, and then to St Pancras before being able to get to Bedford. They did really well not to let it dampen their spirits.

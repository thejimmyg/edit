    Welcome to my personal site.
</p><h2>
    About
</h2><p>
    This site covers my life and work.
    It is <strong>designed</strong> to work by <em>opening</em>
    index.html directly from the filesystem - no web server required.
</p><p>
    Everything uses relative paths and avoids JavaScript features that
    require a secure context.
</p><h2>
    Philosophy
</h2><p>
    The goal is to make authoring as simple as possible.
    Each page is just
    a script tag and body content.
    The script handles all the navigation,
    styling, and interactive features.
</p><p>
    No build step is required.
    Just edit the HTML and refresh.
</p><h2>
    Structure
</h2><p>
    Each page lives in its own directory with an index.html file.
    Special
    directories prefixed with underscore hold scripts, assets, and derived
    files.
</p><p>
    The sitemap is defined in the JavaScript file, making it easy to add
    new pages and have them appear in navigation automatically.
</p><h2>
    Features
</h2><p>
    The script injects a title from the first heading, adds navigation
    breadcrumbs for deeper pages, and creates a scrollspy in the right
    column for quick navigation within the page.
</p><p>
    Top-level navigation links appear on every page, making it easy to
    jump between major sections.

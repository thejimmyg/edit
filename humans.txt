/* SITE ARCHITECTURE */

Opens directly from filesystem - no web server required.

/* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE */

Each page is an index.html in its own directory. The root _script/view.js
is shared across all pages. Directories may contain _asset/ for source files.

/* HTML PAGE FORMAT */

Pages contain:
  1. A <script> tag loading the relative path to _script/view.js
  2. A <noscript> tag with link to sitemap.html (for no-JS browsers)
  3. The body content (starting with an <h1>)

The script injects viewport meta, inline styles, header (breadcrumbs + section
nav), wraps content in <main>, and adds a footer with Top link.

/* LAYOUT */

Single column, full width, browser defaults. Sticky header with backdrop blur.

Breadcrumbs and section nav both left-aligned with gap between.

/* NAVIGATION */

Pages with children are "sections". Pages without children are "leaves".

Site title: Bold link to home, text from sitemap root entry.

Breadcrumbs: Path to current section with / separator. All items linked
except current section (plain text). Leaf pages don't add breadcrumb depth.

Section nav: Children of current section. On leaf pages, shows siblings
with current page as plain text.

Unlisted pages: Pages not in the sitemap inherit navigation from their
nearest ancestor that is in the sitemap. For example, individual blog posts
show the same navigation as the blog section page.

Footer: Right-aligned Top link, only visible when page is scrollable and
not at top.

/* SITEMAP */

Navigation structure is defined in sitemap/index.html. Run `make sitemap`
to generate _script/sitemap.js which is loaded by view.js. The sitemap
page appears in navigation like any other page.

/* AUTHORING */

To create a new page:
  1. Create a directory with index.html
  2. Add script tag, noscript tag, and content starting with <h1>
  3. Add the page to sitemap.html
  4. Run `make sitemap`

/* EDITING */

Ctrl+E or ?edit enters edit mode. Content becomes editable in the browser.
The footer is hidden and content is constrained to max 1000px width.

Keyboard shortcuts:
  Ctrl+2/3/4  Heading levels
  Ctrl+0      Paragraph
  Ctrl+L      Bulleted list
  Tab         Indent list item
  Shift+Tab   Dedent list item
  Ctrl+K      Add/edit link (select text first, prompt for URL, empty to remove)
  Ctrl+B      Bold/strong (select text first)
  Ctrl+I      Italic/em (text selected) or alt text (image/video selected)

Ctrl+J      Cycle fit mode (image/video selected): none -> toowide -> tootall

Selection in JS: Text selection returns content via selection.toString().
Media selection brackets the element within its parent - the range's
startContainer equals endContainer, and endOffset - startOffset equals 1,
with the media at childNodes[startOffset].

Videos in edit mode have no controls (static preview like images). Click to
select, then use Ctrl+I for alt text or Ctrl+J for fit mode. Use View mode
to preview playback.

Drag and drop images or videos onto page to insert. Media shows as previews
and is referenced by SHA256 hash (first 12 chars):
  - Images: _gallery/HASH.jpg
  - Videos: _gallery/HASH.mp4 with poster="_gallery/HASH-poster.jpg"

Dimensions stored as data-width and data-height. Videos also store
data-duration (in seconds).

Note: Drag-and-drop uses crypto.subtle for hashing, which requires a secure
context (localhost or HTTPS). Access via IP address over HTTP won't work.

Gallery rows: Images and videos on the same line form a gallery row. Press
Enter between media to create separate rows. The saved HTML preserves line
breaks which view.js uses to build the gallery table. Mixed rows of images
and videos are supported.

Saving:
  "Copy HTML" - copies formatted HTML to clipboard via navigator.clipboard API
  "Save" - (server mode only) POSTs the HTML to the server, which writes it
           directly to the file. Only appears when served via HTTP.
  "Download" - creates a Blob with text/html content, generates a temporary URL
               via URL.createObjectURL(), triggers download via anchor click.
               Right-click and "Save As" to choose location.
  "View" - exits edit mode (navigates to page without ?edit)

/* DEVELOPMENT SERVER */

Run `make serve` to start the development server. This uses serve.py, a simple
Python HTTP server that serves static files and handles POST requests to save
edited pages directly to disk.

The server:
  - Binds to 0.0.0.0:8000 (accessible from other devices on the network)
  - Serves static files like Python's built-in http.server
  - Accepts POST to any /path/index.html and writes the body to that file
  - Redirects back to the page after saving

serve.py is intentionally minimal and readable - see the source for details.

/* MEDIA GALLERIES */

Consecutive <img> and <video> tags form a row. The script wraps them in a
table with equal-width columns. Separate rows with any block element (p, h2,
etc) or line breaks in the source HTML. Images and videos can be mixed in
the same row.

/* MEDIA PROCESSING */

Images and videos are content-addressed by SHA256 hash. Workflow:

  1. `make index`   - scans ~/Pictures for images and videos, builds
                      ~/.cache/picture-index (hash → filepath mapping)
  2. Drag media in edit mode - computes hash, inserts reference
  3. `make gallery` - finds image hashes in HTML, generates sizes from index
  4. `make videos`  - finds video hashes in HTML, transcodes from index

`make` or `make all` runs: sitemap, index, gallery, videos

Cleanup targets:
  `make unused`        - delete files with unreferenced hashes and obsolete
                         size variants (e.g., old 480p/720p after changing sizes)
  `make clean-symlinks` - delete symlinks so they can be recreated with
                         current default sizes (run gallery/videos after)

Image formats indexed: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, heic, heif
Video formats indexed: mp4, mov, mkv, webm, avi

Image output (requires ImageMagick):
  - Sizes: 400, 800, 1600, 2400 pixels (longest edge)
  - HASH.jpg symlinks to HASH-800.jpg as default
  - Auto-orient, sharpen, strip metadata, progressive JPEG at quality 75

Video output (requires ffmpeg):
  - Resolutions: 360p, 540p (height-based scaling, width auto)
  - Codec: H.264 (main profile, level 4.0), AAC audio at 96kbps
  - Quality: CRF 26 (good balance of size/quality for web)
  - Uses -movflags +faststart for Safari streaming (moov atom at start)
  - HASH.mp4 symlinks to HASH-540p.mp4 as default
  - HASH-poster.jpg extracted from first frame

view.js handles responsive sizing differently for images and videos:

  Images: Uses srcset and sizes attributes. The browser chooses the best size
  based on display width and device pixel ratio. srcset lists all available
  widths (400w, 800w, 1600w, 2400w), sizes is set to container width / items
  per row. Fallback src is the 800px version.

  Videos: JavaScript selection at page load. No srcset equivalent exists for
  video, so src is rewritten directly. Selection logic:
    - Gallery videos: 540p if display width > 400px, else 360p
      (display width = min(1000, viewport) / items per row)
    - Standalone videos: 540p if viewport > 500px, else 360p

Videos not in gallery tables (e.g., inline in paragraphs) are constrained
to max-width: 100% via CSS and still get resolution selection applied.

/* NO-JS FALLBACK */

Each page includes a <noscript> link to sitemap.html. Browsers without
JavaScript (lynx, w3m, links, elinks) can navigate via the sitemap.

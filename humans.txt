/* SITE ARCHITECTURE */

Opens directly from filesystem - no web server required.

/* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE */

Each page is an index.html in its own directory. The root _script/jimmyg.js
is shared across all pages. Directories may contain _asset/ for source files.

/* HTML PAGE FORMAT */

Pages contain:
  1. A <script> tag loading the relative path to _script/jimmyg.js
  2. A <noscript> tag with link to sitemap.html (for no-JS browsers)
  3. The body content (starting with an <h1>)

The script injects viewport meta, inline styles, header (breadcrumbs + section
nav), wraps content in <main>, and adds a footer with Top link.

/* LAYOUT */

Single column, full width, browser defaults. Sticky header with backdrop blur.

Breadcrumbs and section nav both left-aligned with gap between.

/* NAVIGATION */

Pages with children are "sections". Pages without children are "leaves".

Breadcrumbs: Path to current section with > separator. All items linked
except current section (plain text). Leaf pages don't add breadcrumb depth.

Section nav: Children of current section. On leaf pages, shows siblings
with current page as plain text. Sections shown in bold.

Footer: Right-aligned Top link, only visible when page is scrollable and
not at top.

/* SITEMAP */

Navigation structure is defined in sitemap/index.html. Run `make sitemap`
to generate _script/sitemap.js which is loaded by jimmyg.js. The sitemap
page appears in navigation like any other page.

/* AUTHORING */

To create a new page:
  1. Create a directory with index.html
  2. Add script tag, noscript tag, and content starting with <h1>
  3. Add the page to sitemap.html
  4. Run `make sitemap`

/* EDITING */

Ctrl+E or ?edit enters edit mode. Content becomes editable in the browser.

Keyboard shortcuts:
  Ctrl+2/3/4  Heading levels
  Ctrl+0      Paragraph

Drag images onto page to insert. Images use _gallery/filename.jpg paths.
Run `make` to process source images into _gallery/.

Click "Copy HTML" then paste into editor. Click "View" to exit edit mode.

/* IMAGE GALLERIES */

Consecutive <img> tags form a row. The script wraps them in a flex container
with equal widths. Separate rows with any block element (p, h2, etc).

/* NO-JS FALLBACK */

Each page includes a <noscript> link to sitemap.html. Browsers without
JavaScript (lynx, w3m, links, elinks) can navigate via the sitemap.

/* SITE ARCHITECTURE */

Opens directly from filesystem - no web server required.

/* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE */

Each page is an index.html in its own directory. The root _script/jimmyg.js
is shared across all pages. Directories may contain _asset/ for source files.

/* HTML PAGE FORMAT */

Pages contain only:
  1. A <script> tag loading the relative path to _script/jimmyg.js
  2. The body content (starting with an <h1>)

The script injects viewport meta, inline styles, header (breadcrumbs + section
nav), wraps content in <main>, and adds a footer with Top link.

/* LAYOUT */

Single column, full width, browser defaults. Sticky header with backdrop blur.

Breadcrumbs and section nav both left-aligned with gap between.

/* NAVIGATION */

Pages with children are "sections". Pages without children are "leaves".

Breadcrumbs: Path to current section with > separator. All items linked
except current section (plain text). Leaf pages don't add breadcrumb depth.

Section nav: Children of current section. On leaf pages, shows siblings
with current page as plain text. Arrow shown on items with children.

Footer: Right-aligned Top link, only visible when page is scrollable and
not at top.

/* SITEMAP */

Navigation is defined in the sitemap object at the top of jimmyg.js.

/* AUTHORING */

To create a new page:
  1. Create a directory with index.html
  2. Add script tag and content starting with <h1>
  3. Update sitemap in jimmyg.js

/* TERMINAL BROWSERS */

Designed to work in browsh (headless Firefox) or carbonyl (Chromium).
